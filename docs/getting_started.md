- [ ] 1. The first part is the setup the ROS2 side, with the low-level [crisp_controllers](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_controllers) for the robots and other nodes for cameras, grippers and sensors. 
- [ ] 2. Then, you will try moving the robot using [CRISP_PY](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_py) python interface.
- [ ] 3. Finally, you can set up [CRISP_GYM](https://github.com/utiasDSL/crisp_gym) - the Gymnasium interface - and start policy deployment or teleoperation.
